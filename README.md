- **Lyrics Guess Game**\
  (_Rest API_)\
  [Project link](https://es-guess-game.netlify.app/)\
  Simple app to entertain me and my friends in train or meeting. We love this band, so all lyrics are from their albums. Lyrics randomly get from free lyrics API. You should guess, what song has this lyrics line and check your answer by pressing "Show answer" button. If you can't guess, or line is garbage (like "Instrumental part"), you can try new random line of the same song. "New song" gets new random song and line from it.
